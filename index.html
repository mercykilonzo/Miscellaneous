                <p>I am Mercy Mwikali, a student at AkiraChix.<br>
                    As of now i would introduce myself as a software engineer in traning.<br> 
                    This is after being a student at AkiraChix for the past 30days. <br>
                    Before joining this institution, i had always wanted to be more that someone who uses tech product. <br>
                    I wanted to be one of the people in the background building this products. <br>
                </p>
            
                    <p> This dream i had is slowly turning into reality since i joined AkiraChix. <br>
                        AkiraChix has changed me from a student to a software engineer through the different courses they offer. <br>
                       This courses not only traning me on being the best software engineer there is but also the best version of myself i can be.
